#Second, the scipy implementation of Hamming distance will always return a number between 0 an 1.
# Rather than summing the number of differences in dimensions, this implementation sums those differences and then divides by the total number of dimensions.
# For example, in your implementation, the Hamming distance between [1, 2, 3] and [7, 2, -10] would be 2. In scipyâ€˜s version, it would be 2/3.
